# Statistics is a beneficial and interesting subject and I feel so lucky to major in BioStatistics. Thanks to Dr. Mu He for instructing me so much on BioStatistics learning(such as agreeing to accept me to his SURF project during my first summer vacation in XJTLU) and letting me know GitHub is a good way to push me forward every day

#   Learning has another significance for me: demonstrating meaning to teachers who have taught me----teachers will be more motivated to instruct more students if students they have taught make more progress because of them. This positive circle will lead to a more beautiful world because of higher-quality education. Education is a great thing relevant to  everyone. This always plays a great role in adding more motivation even enthusiasm to my learning journey. I feel so lucky to learn from a lot of good and kind teachers from my childhood to now and I believe to my future. So thanks so much to my dear parents who always support my dream.
