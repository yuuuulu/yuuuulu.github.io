## Good Quotes with My Feeling (relavent to my understanding of my major)

+ "Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity of the appetite, for adventure over the love of ease."

  - This quote is from the poem "Youth", which could serve as a call to young statisticians to be bold: venture out of the comfort of theoretical work, take risks in collaborating across fields, and engage with messy, real-world data. This spirit of adventure is what will keep the field vibrant and ensure its continued relevance in the evolving landscape of science and technology.

+ "Theorem go, theorem come, only examples lie forever."
      
  - This highlights the enduring value of real-world impact over theoretical intricacies.It is through practical examples, solving real problems, that statistical methods prove their lasting worth.
    
     (Thinking more concisely and wisely by leveraging examples in our beautiful nature.)
     
     (Examples remain fixed points of reference, giving continuity in the landscape of mathematical thought.)
     
- Feeling: During university, when laying the foundation of knowledge, it's essential to focus on theoretical fundamentals, including mathematical analysis (such as Fourier analysis, real analysis, complex analysis, and functional analysis), and a profound understanding of linear algebra. As statisticians venture out to apply their skills, they should carry these foundational principles with them, dedicating themselves more to real-world applications that benefit society. For me, it is especially in fields like medicine, which is particularly relevant for a student of biostatistics.Balancing deep theoretical work with practical applications during university life of a statistics- majored student will keep the field dynamic and ensure its continued relevance in the evolving landscape of science and technology.
     
+ "The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible." --Albert Einstein

  - the ability to make sense of complex data is at the heart of what makes the discipline so valuable.    not only in embracing theoretical rigor, which is inherently demanding and critical, but also in seeking out opportunities to collaborate across disciplines and tackle real-world data challenges.



## Wisdom of the west


+ "No man's knowledge here can go beyond his experience."

  - Gain experience beyond immediate theoretical boundariesâ€”to immerse themselves in the problems of biology, economics, medicine, and more. By doing so, they expand their understanding and ensure their work remains benefit.
                  
+ "Once a science becomes solidly groundly, it proceeds more or less independently"

  - In this case, the philosophy meaning of bioststistics still stands well.
